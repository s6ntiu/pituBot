PituBot is a multifunctional bot, it has many useless functions you can try.
This bot is not meant to be integrated anywhere. It is open source just for me to document my learning journey on Python.


This bot, as of now, 22nd of July 2025, has three functions
- MudaePitu (made to learn SQL integration and discord embeds). sm to drop.
- MistralaiChat: you can chat with Mistralai AI on a discord chat.  Commands are "startchat" and "endchat". If response exceeds discord character limit it will send the response as a .txt instead.
- mal: with "anime {arg}" you can get info from myanimelist.net for the anime you specified in the {arg}. It uses MAL APIs.
